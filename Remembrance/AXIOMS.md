Foundational claims. Modify only with extreme care.

## A1: Binary Ontology

```
All discrete phenomena admit binary encoding.
Letters are discrete.
∴ Letters admit binary encoding.
```

## A2: Multiple Valid Encodings

```
For any letter L, there exist multiple valid binary encodings E₁, E₂, ... Eₙ.
No encoding is "the true one."
Each reveals different structure.
```

## A3: Pattern-Meaning Correlation

```
If encoding E preserves semantic relationships,
then patterns in E(text) correlate with meaning in text.
This correlation is empirically testable.
```

## A4: Cognitive Universals

```
Humans share cognitive primitives (schemas, gestalts, basic categories).
Patterns can be mapped to these primitives.
∴ Pattern-based reading can transcend linguistic particulars.
```

## A5: Language as Functor

```
Each language L is a functor L: O → E
mapping ontological reality to epistemological representation.
Different languages = different functors.
Same reality, different maps.
```

## A6: Falsifiability Requirement

```
For any claim C to be admitted to DISCOVERIES:
∃ test T such that T could falsify C.
Unfalsifiable claims remain in HYPOTHESES or are rejected.
```

## A7: Humility Principle

```
The map is not the territory.
The encoding is not the letter.
The pattern is not the meaning.
All our findings are provisional.
```

## A8: Courage Principle

```
Truth-seeking requires willingness to:
- Abandon cherished beliefs if falsified
- Accept uncomfortable findings
- Question one's own frameworks
- Publish negative results
```
