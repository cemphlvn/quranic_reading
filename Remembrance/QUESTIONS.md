# QUESTIONS

Living document. Questions arise, transform, get answered or dissolved.

---

## Foundational

- Q1: Is there a "natural" encoding or are all equally arbitrary?
- Q2: What is the minimum bit-depth for semantic preservation?
- Q3: Can binary reading ever replace linguistic reading or only supplement?

## Methodological

- Q4: How do we validate cross-cultural schema activation without language?
- Q5: What constitutes sufficient evidence for pattern-meaning correlation?
- Q6: How do we avoid confirmation bias in pattern discovery?

## Philosophical

- Q7: If binary encoding reveals structure, who/what put that structure there?
- Q8: Does computational reading honor or diminish the text?
- Q9: What are the ethical limits of this research?

## Technical

- Q10: Best visualization modality for bit patterns?
- Q11: Optimal granularity: letter, word, verse, surah?
- Q12: How to handle encoding ambiguity (letters with multiple valid encodings)?

## The Meta-Question

```
Are you brave enough to seek the truth no matter what?
```

This question doesn't get answered. It gets lived.
