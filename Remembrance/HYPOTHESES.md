# HYPOTHESES

Active research questions. Each owned by a project thinker.

## H1: The Dot Density Hypothesis

**Owner:** project_alpha_thinker

```
CLAIM: Letters with dots (nuqat) mark semantic density points.
       Dot-presence encoding (dotted=1, undotted=0) correlates with
       information density in the text.

PREDICTION: High dot-density regions contain more novel/emphasized concepts.
            Low dot-density regions contain more connective/structural elements.

TEST: Compare dot-density across functionally different text segments.
      Correlate with semantic annotation if available.

STATUS: UNTESTED
```

## H2: The Muqatta'at Key Hypothesis

**Owner:** project_beta_thinker

```
CLAIM: The disconnected letters (حروف مقطعة) at surah openings
       encode structural keys for reading the surah.

PREDICTION: Binary encoding of muqatta'at letters predicts
            statistical properties of their surah's text.

TEST: Encode muqatta'at → derive predicted properties → compare with actual.
      Null hypothesis: random correlation.

STATUS: UNTESTED
```

## H3: The Cross-Linguistic Schema Hypothesis

**Owner:** project_gamma_thinker

```
CLAIM: Cognitive schemas (container, path, force, balance) are universal.
       Binary patterns can activate these schemas directly,
       bypassing language-specific encoding.

PREDICTION: Humans from different linguistic backgrounds will
            assign similar meanings to identical bit patterns
            when presented in abstract form.

TEST: Present bit-pattern visualizations to diverse populations.
      Measure semantic convergence vs. divergence.

STATUS: UNTESTED
```

## H4: The Encoding Preservation Hypothesis

**Owner:** project_delta_thinker

```
CLAIM: Different encoding paradigms preserve different semantic axes.
       Phonetic encoding preserves articulatory meaning.
       Morphological encoding preserves visual meaning.
       Numerical encoding preserves mystical/structural meaning.

PREDICTION: For any semantic axis A, there exists an optimal encoding E_A
            that maximally preserves relationships along A.

TEST: Define semantic axes. Measure preservation per encoding.
      Identify best encoding per axis.

STATUS: UNTESTED
```

## H5: The Entropy-Complexity Hypothesis

**Owner:** project_epsilon_thinker

```
CLAIM: Shannon entropy of encoded surah correlates with
       thematic/conceptual complexity.

PREDICTION: Surahs dealing with complex theological topics show
            higher entropy than surahs with simpler, repeated themes.

TEST: Encode all surahs. Compute entropy. Correlate with
      independent complexity ratings (if available) or
      thematic diversity measures.

STATUS: UNTESTED
```

## Meta-Hypothesis

```
At least one of H1-H5 will be validated.
At least one of H1-H5 will be falsified.
The ratio reveals something about the field's viability.
```
