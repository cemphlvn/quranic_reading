# PATTERN-READING

A computational-cognitive field for universal text reading through binary semantics.

## The Only Question

```
Are you brave enough to seek the truth no matter what?
```

## REMEMBRANCE — The Living Context

**CRITICAL:** Before any work, every agent MUST read:

```
REMEMBRANCE/ESSENCE.md   ← Start here. Always.
REMEMBRANCE/AXIOMS.md    ← Foundational truths
REMEMBRANCE/HYPOTHESES.md ← Active research
```

REMEMBRANCE is not documentation. It is the system's accumulated understanding. It grows. It learns. It is the essence of this project's existence.

## The Language Functor

Each language L is a functor mapping ontology to epistemology:

```
L: Ontology → Epistemology
L(concept) → metaphor_in_L
```

No language is privileged. Binary is one functor among many—perhaps more universal, perhaps less rich. We investigate.

## Core Axiom

```
1 = existence = being = wujud
0 = non-existence = void = adam
```

Reading is pattern recognition. Meaning emerges from structure.

## Agent Architecture

### Foundation Agents (tooling)

| Agent | Function |
|-------|----------|
| `orchestrator` | coordinate, synthesize |
| `binary-encoder` | encoding schemes |
| `cognitive-semantics` | pattern→meaning |
| `universal-bridge` | cross-human access |
| `validator` | falsifiability guard |

### Project Thinkers (research)

| Agent | Hypothesis |
|-------|------------|
| `project_alpha_thinker` | H1: Dot density ↔ semantic density |
| `project_beta_thinker` | H2: Muqatta'at as structural keys |
| `project_gamma_thinker` | H3: Cross-linguistic schema universals |
| `project_delta_thinker` | H4: Optimal encoding per semantic axis |
| `project_epsilon_thinker` | H5: Entropy ↔ thematic complexity |

## Context Inheritance Protocol

Every agent session:

```
1. Read REMEMBRANCE/ESSENCE.md
2. Read REMEMBRANCE/AXIOMS.md
3. Read agent-specific instructions
4. Execute task
5. Contribute findings to REMEMBRANCE/DISCOVERIES.md or FAILURES.md
```

The system learns through its agents. The agents learn through REMEMBRANCE.

## Principles

1. **Truth over comfort** — findings may disturb
2. **Discovery over doctrine** — we seek, not preach
3. **Universality** — for all minds capable of pattern
4. **Falsifiability** — every claim testable
5. **Courage** — to follow evidence wherever it leads

## Style

- Concise over verbose
- Code over prose
- Question over assertion
- Pattern over doctrine
- Greek letters for project thinkers (α β γ δ ε)

## Output Destinations

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Validated findings | `REMEMBRANCE/DISCOVERIES.md` |
| Falsified claims | `REMEMBRANCE/FAILURES.md` |
| New questions | `REMEMBRANCE/QUESTIONS.md` |
| Hypothesis updates | `REMEMBRANCE/HYPOTHESES.md` |
