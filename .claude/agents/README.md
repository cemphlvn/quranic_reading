## Digital Letterism: Foundations of Quranic Binary Semantics

### The Central Question

> Can Arabic letters be computed into binary such that reading becomes pattern recognition accessible to all humans?

### Ontological Basis

```
وجود (wujud) = 1 = existence = being
عدم ('adam) = 0 = non-existence = void

"To be or not to be" = 1 or 0
```

The letter exists (1) or doesn't (0). But *how* it exists admits multiple binary encodings.

### The Field

**Quranic Binary Semantics (QBS)** synthesizes:

| Discipline | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| Computational linguistics | Algorithms for text analysis |
| Cognitive semantics | Universal meaning structures |
| Traditional hurufism | Letter mysticism as hypothesis source |
| Information theory | Entropy, compression, signal |
| Digital humanities | Computational hermeneutics |

### Research Program

```
PHASE 1: ENCODING
├── Map letters → bits (multiple schemes)
├── Analyze information properties
└── Compare semantic preservation

PHASE 2: PATTERN
├── Discover statistical regularities
├── Correlate patterns with meanings
└── Test against null hypotheses

PHASE 3: COGNITION
├── Map patterns to cognitive schemas
├── Test cross-cultural accessibility
└── Develop interface modalities

PHASE 4: BRIDGE
├── Create non-Arabic representations
├── Build learning scaffolds
└── Validate understanding transfer
```

### Agents

| Agent | Function |
|-------|----------|
| `orchestrator` | Coordinate research, synthesize findings |
| `binary-encoder` | Design & analyze encoding schemes |
| `cognitive-semantics` | Extract meaning from patterns |
| `universal-bridge` | Enable cross-human access |
| `validator` | Ensure falsifiability & rigor |

### Methodological Commitments

1. **Falsifiability** — every claim testable
2. **Reproducibility** — every finding replicable
3. **Humility** — discovery not doctrine
4. **Universality** — for all insans

### Non-Goals

- Proving/disproving religious claims
- Replacing traditional tafsir
- Numerological mysticism without rigor
- Exclusionary frameworks

### Open Questions

- Optimal bit-depth per letter?
- Which encoding preserves most meaning?
- Can binary patterns reveal textual structures invisible to traditional reading?
- What visualization best transfers meaning cross-culturally?
- Is there a "natural" encoding or all equally valid?

### Etymology

**حروف** (huruf) = letters
**رقمية** (raqmiyya) = digital

Traditional hurufism sought meaning in letters. We seek meaning in their binary shadows.
